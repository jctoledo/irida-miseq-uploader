----------------------------------
Uploading multiple sequencing runs
----------------------------------

This is very similar to the steps in :ref:`upload_single_seq_run` except for **Step 2**.  
For **Step 2**:   
Select the directory containing the sub-directories that have the SampleSheet.csv files.

    :target: _static/basic_usage/Step2_Multiple.png

In the image above: "selected_directory" is the directory to be selected and
"sub-directory1" and "sub-directory2" each contain a `SampleSheet.csv` file.

Continue with the same remaining steps as :ref:`upload_single_seq_run`.
